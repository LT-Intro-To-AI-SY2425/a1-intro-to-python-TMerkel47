## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I think it is much better than any other programming language I've learned so far. Python is much easier to write code in and it is much quicker than any other language I've learned.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Python is very similar to java but everything is simplified. It is much easier to do what you want since python often works how you think. If you think it out in your head, you can often just type out exactly what you though and the program will understand. For example, instead of writing out a for loop how you would in java, you can use things like len which make it much easier to write the code.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I learned a lot since I've never used python before. It taught me a lot of the simple and important things that I need to know and remember in order to succesfully code in pyhton.
